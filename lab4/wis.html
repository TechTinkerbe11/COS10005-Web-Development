<h1> Programming your own Wireless Information Service(WIS)</h1>

<p> 5 February 2005</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Sending and receiving text messages has become part of our daily activities.

Can you imagine yourselves without a mobile phone for a day? Would you leave home without it? And would you be wondering how those mobile applications are written,

were you can send a text message to a specified number, and you get the necessary information needed in a form of a reply, or simply registering your name for a

contest? </p>

<p>This article discusses the things you need to know in order to program your own wireless information service. In validating the concept, a sample program

was created using Sun Microsystems's Java[tm] 2 Standard Edition (J2SE[tm]) and Java Communication API. The application developed had been tested on a PC equipped

with an infrared dongle that connects to an infrared enabled phone, in this case a Nokia 8310. The application is divided into two parts, the messaging library and

the information service application.</p>

<h1> Understanding the SMS Message</h1>

<p>Before developing the application, let us take a look at how a message is handled by the mobile phone. A Short Messaging Service or SMS text can be up to 160

characters long. Each character of the message is represented using 7 bits instead of 8. 8-bit messages with a maximum of 140 characters are usually not viewable

as text messages. This is normally used for ringtones and images. Unicode (UCS2) text messages,which are used for Asian languages, are 16-bit messages. This type

of messages has a maximum length of 70 characters. Blinking SMS is also represented as a 16-bit message otherwise known as Flash SMS.</p>
