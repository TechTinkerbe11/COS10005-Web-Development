			<h3>Survey</h3>
			<p>A survey is often used in a research project to collect feedback from users of a system or participants
				of an event. Results of the evaluation will be of interest to the researcher(s) to help them determine
				whether the approach is likely to affect the objectives set in the research.</p>

			<h3>Voluntary Participation</h3>
